# CS255-Projects

The client for this project was Driver Pass. This company wanted a full system implemented that their students would use to schedule driving classes and take driving tests. The system needed to have different tiers of access: student, driver, employee, and admin. The drivers and employees need to see student information, and admins need to have backend access for technical support. I believe I made efficient and effective diagrams of the system for use by devlopers and the business owner. These diagrams make it easy to understand the flow and connection of the system while not being overly-complex. If I could improve anything, I would add color to the diagrams. I believe this would make them more visually appealing and easier to understand with simple color coordination. The user needs were critical to the design of this system. Ultimately, the user is the most important part as they are why the system exists to begin with; if the system is not easy to use, they will not use it. The goal was to make the system operate in a simple way that is easy for anyone to understand.
